# CDS490-Project

dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago?select=Chicago_Crimes_2012_to_2017.csv

The dataset that I chose to do Look in focus at the Chicago crime analysis data set which focuses on the increasing number of crimes taking place in Chicago from years 2012 to 2017 and I found this dataset on Kaggle. This dataset has a lot of observations and when looking over and analyzing the data there were some variables that were not as important as others
My goal for this dataset was to modify, analyze and visualize crime trends that were happening and were the most popular and the location. Additionally, I formed a hypothesis which was to predict the average crime rate over time in Chicago and see if it was greater than 20000

There were several methods that I chose to implement in this project that would make it easier for me to answer my hypothesis. I used qualitative and quantitative analysis to help in sorting the variables in the dataset. I also used to statistical analysis to uncover any patterns or trends that were present in my data. Predictive analysis as we are predicting crime and it was important to identify any future outcomes based on the crime trends. Lastly, visualizations and graphs to help better understand the data and see if there are any correlations between variables and make it easier to look at patterns ,outliers and trends. 

The data analysis took some time as this dataset is quite large and I had to first import the correct packages. Next , I looked at the structured of the data frame and there are a total of 1456714 observations of 23 variables. I looked at the categorical variables and numerical variables. 
Then I had to omit the data that was not needed to answer my hypothesis. After my data reduced to  1419591 observations and 23 variables. I also had to change the categorical variables as it is easier when we keep doing our analysis.
I also focused on finding the mean , standard deviations and confidence intervals as these helped in answering my hypothesis and it would help focus on the variables that will be needed to predict crime. Additionally , I also focused on counting the crimes that were committed  , the description , the location and the dates that they occurred. These analysis helped in to know which were the most occurring in the different variables relating to crime data.


There were lots of visualization in this project as I want to visualize the data to better understand and to see patterns , trends and to identify any relationships between variables. 
I plotted histograms first to see the count of variables such as Primary Type of crime , description of crime , year of most crimes committed , arrest made. Bar plots used to focus on the variables mentioned above as they helped in comparing and I used density plots so see changes.
I implemented a pie chart which showed the percent of arrests made , and if a crime was domestic. 
I implemented trends that showed crimes over the dates from 2012 to 2017 and this showed me how crime have decreased.

This week the focus of was on answering and finalizing my hypothesis and getting the results based on the mean,standard deviation and the confidence intervals of the variables year , arrest , primary type to make sure that I was on the right track with how many crimes were commited per year , which types of crimes and the number of arrests.
My hypotheis was not supported and it proved wrong as the rate of crimes per year was higher than I had predicted. 
The analysis and reports have shown that there still need to be efforts made in order to keep decreasing the number of crimes. Overtime , they can still increase and there can be factors that cause it to rise.
