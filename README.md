# CDS490-Project

dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago?select=Chicago_Crimes_2012_to_2017.csv

Still working on the coding portion and making it clear and straight to the point and focsuing on how I can modify and improve as there is lots of data , Added more parts of visualizations to show more ascpects of the data.


update: I worked on more analysis over a few variables and made sure to focusing on comming to my conclusion. I also focused more on analysis and not visualizations as much as i still need to finish analyzing and arrive to answer my conclusion.

 The methods I worked on were statistical analysis and qualatative and quantative.
 
 I worked on polishing my hypothesis and getting the results based on the mean,standard deviation and the confidence intervals of the variables year , arrest , primary type to make sure that I was on the right track with how many crimes were commited per year , which types of crimes and the number of arrests
 I was able to answer my hypotheis and it proved wrong as the rate of crimes per year was higher than I had guessed. 
 I also wanted to include interative plots using plotly but unfourtunately there were numerous amount of errors I was recieving with the variables , in these last weeks I will most definetly work on making everything perfect and ready and be ready to finsih the project.
